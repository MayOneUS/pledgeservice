It's an ingenious plan to make the drive for small-dollar publicly funded elections a central issue in 2016. With a little luck, the Harvard law professor's idea could help save the republic.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/04/25/lawrence-lessig-has-a-moonshot-plan-to-halt-our-slide-toward-plutocracy/" target="_blank">Moyers &amp; Company: &#8220;Lawrence Lessig Has a "Moonshot" Plan to Halt Our Slide Toward Plutocracy&#8221;</a></p><blockquote><p>Harvard's Lawrence Lessig, the crusader for campaign finance reform, feels that his fellow reformers don't think big or boldly enough to inspire the kind of grassroots campaign that might break elite donors' stranglehold on America's political system.</p><p>In a recent piece in<a style="color: #1982d1;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/" target="_blank"><em style="font-style: italic;"> The Atlantic</em></a>, Lessig argues that public cynicism about the prospect of deep reform actually working is the only thing keeping widespread outrage at our slide toward plutocracy in check. And he thinks that only a "moonshot" campaign &mdash; an ambitious, collective, national effort "unlike anything they've seen before" &mdash; can "crack this cynicism" and usher in a more democratic system.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://time.com/84556/lawrence-lessig-superpac/" target="_blank">Time: Campaign Finance Reformer Launches Super PAC to End Super PACs</a></p><blockquote><p>Mayday PAC was already 8 percent of the way toward its goal by Thursday afternoon with more than $75,000 pledged and nearly 31 days left to reach its target.</p><p>To say Mayday PAC faces an uphill fight is an understatement. Proponents of serious campaign finance reform face strong opponents in both parties, and the Supreme Court and lower courts have issued rulings in recent years striking down or throwing into doubt a wide array of restrictions on political spending.</p><p>If the idea behind Mayday PAC sounds absurd, that's by design. Cynicism and defeatism about government run so deep through American politics, Lessig believes, that the only way to "crack this cynicism" is with an idea so exceedingly ambitious&mdash;a "moonshoot," he calls it&mdash;that people might be roused to get behind it.</p><p>"We must show Americans something unlike anything they've seen before," Lessig <a style="color: #0c97d2;" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/campaign-finance-and-the-nihilist-politics-of-resignation/360437/">writes</a>.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2014/05/01/3433006/mayday-super-pac-launches-to-end-super-pacs/" target="_blank">ThinkProgress: Anti-Dark Money Activist Lawrence Lessig Launches A Super PAC To End Super PACs</a></p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mgilens/Gilens%20homepage%20materials/Gilens%20and%20Page/Gilens%20and%20Page%202014-Testing%20Theories%203-7-14.pdf" target="_blank">Recent studies</a> have found that wealthy Americans' influence over politics has grown significantly over the past few decades. Just a few hours after the launch, the Super PAC had raised nearly $50,000 &mdash; 5 percent of its $1 million goal.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/88825/there-s-a-new-super-pac-to-end-all-super-pacs-and-it-could-radically-change-politics?utm_source=policymicTWTR&amp;utm_medium=main&amp;utm_campaign=social" target="_blank">PolicyMic: There&#8217;s a New &#8220;Super PAC to End All Super PACs&#8221; &mdash; And It Could Radically Change Politics</a></p><blockquote><p><strong>So far, it&#8217;s working.</strong> In just a few days, with hardly any publicity, they&#8217;ve managed to raise over $350,000 dollars with a short-term goal of $1 million.</p></blockquote>
