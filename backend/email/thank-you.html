    <p>Dear {name},</p>

    <p>Thank you for your pledge to the MaydayPAC. We are grateful for the support to make it possible for us to win back our democracy.</p>

    <p>But may I ask for one more favor?</p>

    <p>We will only win if we find 100 people for every person like you. It would be incredibly helpful if you could help us recruit them, ideally by sharing the link to the MayOne.US site. We've crafted something simple to copy and paste below. Or you can like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mayonedotus">our Facebook Page</a>, or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/MayOneUS">@MayOneUS</a> on Twitter.</p>

    <p>We'd be grateful for your feedback and ideas for how we can spread this message broadly. We're watching the social media space for #MaydayPAC, or you can email your ideas to <a href="mailto:info@mayone.us">info@mayone.us</a>.</p>

    <p>The is just the beginning. But if we can succeed as we have so far, then by 2016, we will have taken the first critical step to getting our democracy back.</p>

    <p>This email serves as your receipt for your pledge of: {total}</p>

    <p>Thank you again,</p>

    <p>

    <p>I just supported a SuperPAC to end all SuperPACs &ndash; the #MaydayPAC, citizen-funded through a crowd-funded campaign. You can check it out here: http://mayone.us.</p>
